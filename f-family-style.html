    <p class="stylish"><b>Editor’s note:</b> You may have missed this article when CMI published it in 2016. We’re publishing this update because great writing is so essential to successful content marketing.
        Writing isn’t an easy task. Whether you craft words for <span style="font-style:normal">B2B or B2C</span> audiences, the challenges can be many. I’ve created a diverse set of tips, tools, and resources to aid in shaping and modifying your work.It’s not an exhaustive collection. Some ideas may seem familiar. Some will be fresh. My hope is that you’ll walk away with some insights or new tools to help address or minimize the content creation challenges you face.
        When you go in depth, you underscore your authority in an industry. But snack-size content may be more suitable. How much you write depends on your design and whom you’re targeting.
        I understand that short pieces (anything under 500 words) are easier for online readers to consume. But if you don’t write enough, you disappoint someone by not devoting sufficient attention to the topic. Longer content can draw people in. But if you provide too many details you might overwhelm a reader.
        Odds are that your agency or company will have policies that control length. But there should be exceptions. Editors and writers should agree on whether the article is the right length.</p>
