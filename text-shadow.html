    <h1>Welcome to this page</h1>
    <p>When you go in depth, you underscore your authority in an industry. But snack-size content may be more suitable. How much you write depends on your design and whom you’re targeting. I understand that short pieces (anything under 500 words) are easier for online readers to consume. But if you don’t write enough, you disappoint someone by not devoting sufficient attention to the topic. Longer content can draw people in. But if you provide too many details you might overwhelm a reader. Odds are that your agency or company will have policies that control length. But there should be exceptions. Editors and writers should agree on whether the article is the right length.</p>
